# Eye-detection-and-tracking
Eye detection and tracking using OpenCV and Dlib
To do this, you will need to assemble a dataset with lucid dream tags and train the model, for example, on TensorFlow or PyTorch. This is a difficult task and requires significant resources and time.
Notes:
â€¢ The project requires compliance with ethical standards and respect for human rights, as working with biometric data requires confidentiality and data security.
 Lucid dreaming is a complex physiological phenomenon, and its definition by eye movement may be inaccurate without a comprehensive approach involving other biosensors.
